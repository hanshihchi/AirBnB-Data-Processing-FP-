I tend to give the guest space for their privacy and at the same time make sure they have what they need.  This Hotel is pretty laid back, named after my Mom Luz.  I am single and found this hotel in 2004, few months shy of my 50th birthday.  All my staff are my family, my \"modern family\", from the young guy Chad, big guy Albert and (Ruffa) Robert.  They are all very helpful and we want all the guest not to be shy in asking help for anything.  We will do our best to make sure your stay is pleasant and most of all a comfortable one.  Our goal is to give you the feeling that you are staying in your home away from your own home.  Cheers ......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nt",

If you are craving a San Francisco burrito, Taqueria Can-Cun is just around the corner.

      "neighborhood_overview": "The Sunset District is the largest neighborhood within the city and county of San Francisco, and with a population of over 85,000. It is also the most populous. Golden Gate Park forms the neighborhood's northern border, and the Pacific Ocean (or, more specifically, the long, flat strand of beach known as Ocean Beach) forms its western border. A section of the Sunset District towards its southeastern end is known as the Parkside neighborhood. Prior to the residential and commercial development of the Sunset District, much of the area was covered by sand dunes and was originally referred to by 19th century San Franciscans as the \"Outside Lands.\"",

There is easy access to many amenities and to public transportation.  The streetcar stop is one block away.  The streetcar (L Taraval line) will get you downtown in about 20 minutes.  If you have a car, parking is free but can get tricky in the evenings.  (Sometimes we can save spots for our guests.)  The freeways are close also, if you need them.  We are within a couple miles of wonderful parts of San Francisco, including Ocean Beach, Stern Grove, Land’s End  and Golden Gate Park.  There are bars and restaurants within easy walking distance.  There is also a laundromat and a 24 hour convenience store on the corner.   This is a very safe neighborhood.  <br /><br />We have lived in this house for 40 years.  Some neighbors on our block have been here even longer, which is highly unique in San Francisco. <br /><br />We love to walk to the beach (slightly over a mile) and watch the sun set.  ",

We still believe this is the best city in the world, despite its many difficult changes.\n\nI am an outdoor person!  I roller skate all over town, and lead the weekly (world famous) San Francisco Friday Night Skate.  Charlie is an indoor person.  One of his favorite things to do is cook, and he's fabulous at it. \n\nWe will totally respect whatever level of host/guest interaction you desire, and look forward to having you in our home!\nThanks for reading!

I have lived in the Mission for last 18 years and love talking about the neighborhood, world travels and good places to eat. I have lived abroad in East Africa and traveled in Europe and Central/South America. I love learning about new places to visit, especially coastal spots and warm spots, and trying new foods.  Our profile pictures are shots of us traveling in Mexico, Spain, France and Armenia.\r\n\r\nWe live in this apartment too, so you will see us hanging out in the kitchen and common areas.  Our bedroom is towards the back of the house, while the three guest rooms are in the front of the house.  I try to balance visiting with guests and having alone time.  The house tends to be pretty quiet and mellow. We specifically do not rent to couples so that there are a max of three guests at any time.\r\nSebouh lives downstairs and you will see him occasionally. He speaks fluent Armenian and is a plumber and works out of our house, so he comes and goes throughout the day. ",

Excellent restaurants with varying cuisines.  Cute shops, like Noe Valley except you can always find a parking place. That's one reason it is now the hottest real estate market in the country, so the real estate association reports.",

We chose to live and raise a family which includes our three children in San Francisco because of the beautiful landscape, amazing culture and diversity, priceless climate and lets not forget exploring this beautiful city through the iconic cable car rides.\n\nAs a family we enjoy spending most of our time outdoors which includes hiking in the Marin Headlands, breezy walks along Ocean Beach, as well as biking in Golden Gate Park to name a few. Camping is a major part of our summer routine in Lake Tahoe, Yosemite National Park, and Camp Mendocino. We also enjoy Lake Tahoe during the winter months for skiing and snowboarding. Noelle and I are also avid sports fans and LOVE attending San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, Golden State Warriors, San Francisco Forty Niners, Oakland Raiders and San Jose Shark games with our children and friends. Our weekends are also consumed with youth sports as our children play on baseball, basketball, golf, and swimming teams.\n\n We are lucky enough to live in an area which embraces the arts and we are just a short stroll away from the many music festivals which San Francisco has to offer and a few of our favorite events to attend are the Blue Grass Festival and Outside Lands both in Golden Gate Park. \n\nSan Francisco offers a variety of multi-cultural cuisine all within a short distance from each other whether it be a walk, drive or door step away. Some of our favorites include, fresh seafood, Pho, Mission-style burritos, Korean BBQ, Cioppino, or exploring our palates with tasting world renowned wine and cheese at the Ferry Building! ",

      "host_about": "I live  alone in my our art filled home in the Lower Haight — central to everything. I retired from working downtown in Union Square; it takes very little effort to get there, three stops on MUNI. Our public-transit system is everywhere and very close to the house (be it a MUNI, the N Judah — underground — or the street car on Market Street). Our closest surrounding neighborhoods are Hayes Valley, Duboce Triangle, The Castro (just underwent extensive renovations), the Upper Haight and Valencia Street in the Mission District. On Waller Street we're literally steps away from some of the best food, bars and shopping (not tourist spots). The Lower Haight was voted the number one neighborhood in San Francisco by the tech community. Most important, do not rent a large car or let the car agency upgrade you to a larger car. Parking is too difficult. The rental agency tries to unload larger cars by offering visitors an upgrade. Don't accept it. I allow my guests to park in the street in front of my garage providing there is enough room.\r\n\r\nMy home (pre earthquake Edwardian) has been with me for more than forty years, so you can ask me anything that you want to know about the Bay Area and I am  bound to point you in the right direction. What else... Ah, just feel free to be in touch. I look forward to having you around! \rI just concluded my ninth year as a host on Airbnb. I am continually told that my price is too low. I am OK with my fee. I really want my guests to have a great time when staying in my home. To paraphrase the clothing designer Tom Ford, \" Surrounding yourself with beautiful objects, enhances the quality of your life\". It is my  unofficial motto. \n\nAfter hosting many guests from many different places, I learned that it is important to understand that when you book my home you are also experiencing my life. I have friends that stop by. I occasionally have people for dinner. It is essential to understand that I am not a professional innkeeper. I am not running a bed and breakfast. I am an Airbnb host who accept guests to stay in my guest bedrooms. I want my guests to live like residents of San Francisco. My neighborhood is very popular. When you stay with me you are returning to your San Francisco home.",

      "description": "Traditional and quintessential San Francisco house with updated baths. You will be on 2nd / main floor. We are downstairs in garden unit with separate entrance. Sleeps 6 with 2 bedrooms + 1 sofa bed. Conveniently located 10 min walk from Balboa Park BART station (12 min downtown, 20 min SFO). Mission Terrace is a friendly, family oriented and sunny neighborhood with colorful homes, blooming gardens and local markets. Perfect for those wanting a quiet place but quick access to other parts of SF",
      "neighborhood_overview": "Mission Terrace is a friendly and safe community south of San Francisco downtown. It shares the same intimate vibe of its more central neighbors. Colorful homes replete with blooming gardens line the sunny streets, and local markets and pizza parlors are more common than strip malls and national chains. The neighborhood is also bounded by several transportation corridors (freeways and BART stations included), helping the neighborhood to remain quiet while providing quick access to energetic nighttime neighborhoods.",
